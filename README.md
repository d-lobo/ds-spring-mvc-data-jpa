# Demo Project - Spring MVC & Data (JPA)

A example demonstrating a typical rest-based microservice with spring-data (jpa).

It contains a typical crud rest api with some exception handling, a service & model layer.

This demo is not intended to be run anywhere, thus no db configured (using embedded h2)
